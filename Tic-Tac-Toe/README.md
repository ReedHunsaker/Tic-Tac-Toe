# Overview

A terminal tic-tac-toe game I made to learn the syntax of the C++ language.

The game is played by 2 human players that take turns. They can choose their names and play multiple rounds. Each round the game will save the outcome of who won or lost. This match history saves even when the game is terminated. 

This software was written to help give me a deeper understanding of the C++ language and to demenstrate my knowledge. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
